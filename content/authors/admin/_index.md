I am currently a PhD student in the Queen Mary University of London's Astronomy Unit. My research focuses on topics in early universe cosmology such as inflation, primordial black holes and gravitational waves. I regularly deliver outreach talks on both standard cosmology and my own research.

Outside of my research I dabble in several areas of philosophy. I am particularly interested in fine-tuning issues in cosmology and what we should infer from them. I am an atheist and regularly enjoy exploring arguments for and against the existence of God.

I find the world around us utterly fascinating to investigate from all angles. I love to share the interesting things I've learned via social media and outreach. On my two YouTube channels, Physically Debunked and Shots In The Quark, I discuss the science and philosophy which informs my atheism and various topics in philosophy of physics that I think more people should be aware of.
